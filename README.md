# RglBanScraper

A repo containg scrapers written in various ways to help detect when there was a ban at RGL.

# Versions

- v1
  Written in node.js where the primary focus was to use packages to manage the scraping. It also has a docker image to run so it can be easily ran anywhere.

- v2
  Written purely in JavaScript, v2 was meant to be ran in a cloud function on an interval. This way, you won't need to have docker installed nor do you need to have a server running.
